========================================

Stenography expertise, original concept, feature design, and testing
by Mirabai Knight. Code and technical design by Joshua Harlan
Lifton. Additional code contributions by Hesky Fisher.

Contact the authors if you would like Plover to support your stenotype
machine.


Warning
-------

Plover is not mature software. Once running, it will interpret all
keystrokes according to the stenography dictionary you provide. Be
careful what you type. When using the Sidewinder or any other normal
keyboard with Plover, your normal keyboard shortcuts may not work. Use
the mouse or stop the Plover program if you are unsure of what will
result from typing.

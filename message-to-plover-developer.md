Hello,

Here again to share how i use Plover trying to get it work in french. It's based on the [Grandjean V layout](http://www.stenograph.com/pages.aspx?docid=250&id=)

I'm hosting it in github as [plover-france](https://github.com/azizyemloul/plover-france) (it's maybe not the proper way to make things and i'am sorry about it. i was struggling to learn git, the repository is not forked, i thought that naming it other thing than plover would avoid conflict between push and pull remotes, i know i was wrong, thanks for your comprehension)

I made an explanation about the keyboard on a french README.org file. I will be pleased to give some explanation in english if needed.

I'm a trainee at [St√©notype Grandjean](http://www.stenotype-grandjean.com/), the school founded by Marc Grandjean. I'm looking for the 140 WPM. I'm working as a freelance note-taker since 2006 on a pc keyboard. I switched to linux and discovered without pretention the joy of coding, Thanks to open source spirit.

I demonstrated Plover in french for my stenography teacher in school and she was amazed. I showed it to some other students and they had the same reaction.

I will be pleased to use Plover for my current job and give the chance to others students to use it but i have to do some additional work in the linguistic part of it. I don't know if there's other french users who can help with this part but if Plover adopt the Grandjean layout it would give more chance to make it greatly functional for french. I hope so.

I started a project for a [plover french dictionary](https://github.com/azizyemloul/plover-france-dict) I use a great free lexical database [Lexique380](http://www.lexique.org/) sponsored by the CNRS ([NFS](http://www.nsf.gov/) equivalent in US) and executed by the [Paris 5 Descartes University](http://www.univ-paris5.fr/).

Their syllabic chunking of Lexique380 was hopefully very near to what is actually professedin stenography. I realized a basic french dict.json. Some specific french orthographic rules makes it bigger than the english one.
